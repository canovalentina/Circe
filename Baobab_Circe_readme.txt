--------------
  - Resolution: 1366x768
  - Character: Circe
  - Controls: 
    - W,A,S,D: Circe Movement
    - Q, E: Camera Movement
    - Space: Jump
    - G: God mode
    - R: Collect Plants

    - Left Ctrl: Throw Explosive Attack (orange potion)
    - Left Shift: Throw Transformation (purple potion)


Levels
-------
  - Main Menu: Start the game and get to know about Circe's backstory
  - Tutorial: Follow the tutorial level for a detailed **step-to-step interactive explanation** on the different gameplay mechanics (potion crafting and powers)! 
  - Island: On the island, continue using the skills you learned from the tutorial (such as how to collect plants and craft potions), with these additional elements:
    - More AI enemies to defeat
    - Interactive Elements
      - Hop on the cloud and land on the building for some collectables
      - Spill potion on the cauldron to open the gate and find the key to the final level
      - NPCs with story-line dialogue
      - Other elements on the island: Passive animals walking around, statues, breakable pottery
  - Athena: Go back to the palace and defeat the final enemy

God Mode
--------
  - Press the "G" key to get unlimited potions and to not be impacted by attacks. This can make it easier to test out the different powers that Circe has

Potion Crafting
---------------
  - Collect single plants or multiple plants from bushes to have all the herbs necessary to create your potions
  - Press the "C" key to toggle the crafting potions panel, where you Circe creates different types of potions, using the Craft buttons, based on the plants she has collected
  - The potion types are:
    - Red: Health (drink)
    - Orange: Explosive (throw)
    - Black: Trap (spill)
    - Gray: Stoneskin (drink)
    - Purple: Transformation (enemies to animals) (throw). Note: Only transforms if health is at 1, if not, it decreases health like the orange potion
    - Yellow: Quest (spill to open doors)

Additional Notes:
-----------------
- It is intentional that Brute enemy's sword sometimes doesn't always injure Circe
- The background music manager is intentionally a single instance that persists across scenes and is set in the first scene (Main Menu). If opening scenes within Unity instead of the build, without starting at Main Menu, then the music will not play.


III) Known Problem Areas:
- The cloud can bump against Athena and send her underneath the island
- The pigs sometimes pass through the fences
- In the Island scene, stairs in the environment houses are not available to walk up/down on
- Brute sometimes disappears when using purple potion at a very close range 

IV) Manifest of which files authored by each teammate:

Arseni Zuyeu (azuyeu3):

Collectables:
-------------
- Configurable animated single collectible ingredient (with particle system)
- Multiple collectible (one for harvesting multiple ingredients) with particle system (if not harvested yet), configurable ingredients yielded and reharvest timer
 
Potions and crafting mechanics:
-------------------------------
- Ingredients and potions types
- Sprite configs for 2d/3d ingredients
- Sprite configs for 2d potions
- Recipes
- Crafting logic (what potions can be crafted with current state of ingredients, updating inventory after craft)
- Inventory state, which can be carried over across scenes
- 2d and 3d prefabs for all potions, except purple
- Crafting UI modal
- Potions HUD (old vertical and new horizontal)
- Highlighting required ingredients and showing short tooltip when mouse over potion in crafting window
- Resetting inventory 

Enemy AI:
---------
- Nav meshes and "naive" following of player if within certain range (was used for demo pitch, and then reused it later scripts and fsm)
- FSM for Brute enemy
- Patrol state - goes from waypoint to waypoint, stops at waypoint for some time to look around
- Chase state - triggers when player is in certain radius + enemy is able to see them (i.e. if forward vector is within certain range + no obstacles between). If player runs away - gets back to patrolling
- Attack state - triggers in close proximity to player
- Stuck state - when collides with black potion trap puddle
- Dead state - when gets hit by player
- Combat - refined auto aim, so it doesn't require to preassign particular enemy per stage, supports multiple enemies, targets closest alive one

Potion actions:
---------------
- Logic of refetching potions when thrown if inventory not empty, switching potions for drinking and spilling upon clicking corresponding buttons
- Explosion for collision with orange potion, also unbound it from particular targets so it can hit any target
- Spilling black potion - spilling with particle system, animated puddle which grows when spill happens, makes enemy stuck on collision
- Drinking red potion - increasing health
- Drinking grey potion - switching to a stone texture for a player + 5s immortability
- Spilling yellow potion - spilling liquid with particle system

Tutorial level:
---------------
- Assembling the whole level logic in tutorial controller
- Tutorial hints - showing tips to user while pausing the game
- Animated gates. show state objective when approached. open with animation once objective is fulfilled
- Hint colliders - show one-time tutorial hint in key areas
- Falling bricks from the ceiling, which decreases HP and triggers hint
- Lava that instantly kills on collision
- Animated fence for enemy combat stage
- Potion puzzle to open gates
- Exit portal (load next level)
- Multiple small scripts to check objectives completion to open the next one

Final level:
----------------
- Assembled the scene for final level

Misc:
-----
- Navigation arrow - points to the current game objective (can be any object on the scene) from the ordered list, switches to next one either if approached or if next one is closer than previous one
- Breakable pottery, with ability to hide ingredient or quest item inside
- Improved forward jumping (using applying force instead of toggling gravity, for more natural jump trajectory and feel)
- God mode (immortability and infinite ammo)
- Abstracted yellow potion puzzle, to make other types of doors work with it as long as inherited from AbstractDoor.
- Game logger(now catching all game events and shows in top left corner)
- Playtesting logger
- Setting game resolution script
- Fixed AI (Athena) rotating to follow player
- Finding assets for things above (potions, ingredients, pottery, ui images, etc.)
- Set up initial repo with imported island as a main scene
